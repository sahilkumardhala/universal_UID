# universal_UID


This project is about creating a universal authentication system that acts both as a single sign-on (SSO) service for third-party websites and a password manager. Youâ€™ll build a Django-based web platform that handles user registration, secure password storage, and OAuth2-based login functionality. By leveraging secure encryption techniques and the OAuth2 protocol, your system will provide users with a convenient and secure way to manage their online identities and credentials across different websites.
